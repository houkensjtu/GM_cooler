# GM_cooler

A simulation program for single-stage GM type cryocooler. Originally created by Y. Matsubara.

## Directory description
```
test/         : Test program to verify the ability of RKGS (Runge-Kutta Method) solver.
src_free/     : Source code for gas-driven GM cryocooler.
src_origin/   : Original source code written by Y. Matsubara.
src_scotch/   : Refactored code based on the original source code.

## How-to compile & run

Inside the source code directory, simply type
``` make all```
to compile the source code. If successfully built, a binary executable file GM_cryocooler.o will be generated.
Before the calculation, you will be asked to input several necessary parameters. Following the instructions
and respond your choice in commandline.

After the operation, some data log files and output images will be generated in the same directory.
To clean the object files and mod file (generated by compiling modules), type
``` make clean```

Note that the default compiler is gfortran ( As written in the Makefile). You may change to your
preferred compiler but unexpected error may occur.

All the code is tested under the following environment:

```
Linux 3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64 GNU/Linux

GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)
