# GM_cooler

A simulation program for single-stage GM type cryocooler. Originally created by Y. Matsubara.

## Directory description
```
├──rkgs/         : A test program to verify the RKGS (Runge-Kutta Method) subroutine.
├──src_origin/   : Original source code written by Y. Matsubara.
├──src/          : Refactored code based on the original source code.
```
## How-to compile

Inside the src/ directory, simply type
``` make all```
to compile the source code. If successfully build, there will be a binary executable file GM_cryocooler.o.
To clean the object files and mod file (generated by compiling modules), type
``` make clean```

Note that the default compiler is gfortran ( As written in the Makefile). You may change to your
preferred compiler but unexpected error may occur.

All the code is tested under the following environment:

```
Linux 3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64 GNU/Linux

GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)
```
